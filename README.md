🚀 Hi, I’m Mavdavids — your go-to for dev solutions that just work.
👨‍💻 Whether it’s untangling a tricky legacy codebase, optimizing a Vue.js frontend, or jumping into a fast-paced codebase with zero hand-holding, I thrive on helping teams solve problems fast and well.

💡 I don't just write code — I ask the why, simplify the how, and always chase the better. You’ll usually find me diving into fresh programming patterns, or mentoring teammates through messy bugs (with coffee in hand ☕).

🛠️ Currently expanding into Machine Learning with Python — because great developers are always stretching their limits.

📬 Need someone who can step in, understand your system quickly, and start making a difference from week one?
